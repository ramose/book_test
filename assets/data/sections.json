You're surrounded by individuals who are not just colleagues or acquaintances but are passionate about technology and eager to share their knowledge. It's an environment where learning is celebrated, and every conversation could lead to a new idea or a better understanding of a complex concept. \n\nI remember the buzz of activity, the anticipation before the keynote speeches, and the shared excitement as we unveiled new technologies. But what stood out to me the most was the collective effort. Everyone played a part, from the organizers to the volunteers, and each role was crucial to the event's success. \nIn the following year, Devfest Bali grew even larger, with more participants and an impressive lineup of speakers. Although I stepped back from volunteering to be a regular participant, the joy of being part of the community didn't diminish. It was a different perspective, but the camaraderie and the thrill of learning remained the same.\n\nOrganizing Google I/O Extended Bali was not just a milestone in my professional journey but also a testament to the power of community.

            "details": "Here is the writeup on my \"Exercise Journey\" from my perspective:\n\nEmbarking on a fitness journey is like setting sail on uncharted waters - exhilarating yet daunting. Two months ago, I heeded a friend's advice and took a leap of faith that has since transformed my life. \n\nI meticulously crafted a gym routine that now punctuates my weekdays with a rhythm that's become the cornerstone of my existence. Mondays are for push exercises, Tuesdays for pull, and Wednesdays challenge me with leg day. Thursdays are my rest days, a crucial aspect of my regimen, and Fridays are for honing my shoulders. This structured routine is more than just about the workouts; it's about instilling the discipline of rest, allowing my body to recover and grow stronger.\n\nIn tandem with my gym routine, I've embraced intermittent fasting, setting a disciplined eating schedule. My mornings begin with breakfast between 9 to 10 AM, followed by lunch around 1 or 2 PM, and I conclude with a meal that includes a mix of fruits before 5 PM. The evenings are now free from eating, a stark contrast to my old habits. It was a struggle at first, but it's now a part of my life that brings me joy. I've become more disciplined and respectful of what I eat, and I don't bother with tracking every calorie.\n\nThe physical progress I've made doesn't directly influence my teaching style or content as a JavaScript facilitator, but I believe that all aspects of my health journey positively impact my daily activities. I approach my classes with a humorous and fun vibe, and my improved stamina allows me to deliver hands-on demos with more dynamism. Although I'm not sure if my students have noticed this change, I always strive to meet a standard in my teaching, ensuring professionalism and self-control in the learning environment.\n\nThe stamina I've gained from this health-focused lifestyle has had a significant impact on my jogging routine. Before, I could barely manage more than a few minutes at a time, but now I find myself sprinting for 5-7 minutes during my Sunday runs at Bajra Sandi Renon yard. It's a remarkable improvement, and while I don't believe I had any mental issues before, I feel a sense of pride in my health achievements. Consistency is all I need.\n\nFor the first time I hit the gym, my weight was around 97kg. After two months of dedication to the gym and fasting, I've lost about 10kg, and my weight is now 87kg. This achievement has not only been a physical transformation but also a mental one. The discipline and consistency I've cultivated in my personal health journey have spilled over into every facet of my life, including my professional endeavors. My target is hitting 85kg by the end of April 2024.All of my gym exercises are a favorite day, but I don't quite enjoy my shoulder day as much. Shoulders are an important part of supporting other exercises like bench press, and I initially lacked knowledge about different shoulder movements. However, I ended up talking and working out with friends who guided me on proper form and breathing techniques. Their advice has made a significant difference, and I now truly enjoy all aspects of my exercise schedule.\nMy friends have been incredibly supportive of my decision to make changes, and without their encouragement, I might not have embarked on this gym journey. Their positivity has even inspired some of them to join me, and I now find myself teaching a senior friend the ropes as a beginner. It's really good having a circle that has a positive vibe to make changes together.\n\nIn essence, the combination of exercise and fasting has been a game-changer for me. It's not just about the physical benefits but also about the mental clarity and discipline that have permeated every aspect of my life. It's a continuous process of growth and development, and I'm committed to seeing just how far this path will lead.",

My favorite gym exercise is actually all of them - I keep a tight schedule and make sure to do each one consistently. I've learned that consistency is key, and it took me a month to make going to the gym a habit. Now, I feel fresh every day, and my outfits fit well. My friends have been really supportive of my transformation, and it's great to have them noticing the changes in me. I've realized that gym exercise isn't just about physical change, but also about building confidence and self-control. It's amazing how much of an impact it's had on my life.",
