Kento was born in Munich on December 6, 2021, and he is the son of my eldest child, Calvin Tan, and his wife, Yuki. . Kento's birth was a memorable moment for our entire family, and he is such a cute and adorable baby. I am blessed and give thanks to God for giving us such a pleasant family.\n\nMy wife, Tay Sek Goh, and I make an effort to stay connected with our children and grandchildren, despite the geographical distance between us.  In May 2022, my wife and I visited Munich for a month to spend time with Kento and his parents. It was a wonderful experience, and we cherished every moment we spent with our grandson. We are already planning our next visit to Munich in April 2024, and we are looking forward to spending more time with Kento and exploring the city together. During our visits to Munich, we enjoy sightseeing and experiencing the local attractions with our family. It's a great way for us to bond and create lasting memories together. We are excited to share these experiences with Kento as he grows older and can appreciate the beauty and history of Munich.  As grandparents, we are committed to supporting Kento and any future grandchildren in their endeavors, just as we have done for our own children. We believe that maintaining a strong family bond is essential, and we will continue to make an effort to stay connected with our loved ones, no matter the distance. As we face challenging times in life, all we can do is encourage each other and support our family members financially, emotionally, and mentally.  Becoming a grandparent has changed my perspective on family and life, making me realize the importance of cherishing every moment and staying connected with our loved ones.",

Her smile was a constant, even during the hardest of times, and her ability to maintain a positive outlook has greatly influenced how I approach life and my relationships with others.\n\nDespite their financial struggles, my parents ensured that we never went hungry, sometimes borrowing from neighbors to provide for us. They were farmers, tapping rubber and rearing pigs, and through their labor, they instilled in us the values of strength and independence. Education was their beacon of hope for us, a tool they believed would pave the way to a better life.\n\nTheir sacrifices were not in vain. I was fortunate enough to complete my higher education in the UK, a dream that was made possible through their efforts and support. This experience has been a cornerstone of my life, shaping my worldview and the manner in which I raised my own children. I have always emphasized the importance of education to my sons, and it fills me with pride to see them as graduates from overseas universities, their horizons broadened by their experiences just as mine were.\n\nThe culinary traditions of my family are a testament to my parents' legacy.

            "details": "Sungei Pelek, my birthplace, holds a special place in my heart. Nestled in the state of Selangor, Malaysia, this small town, just a short drive from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, is where my journey began. The name itself, derived from the Malay word “sungei” meaning “river,” speaks to the natural beauty and serenity that surrounded my childhood home. Growing up in Sungei Pelek, I was part of a large family, with two brothers and seven sisters, living together in a modest wooden house with just five rooms. Life was not easy; our family made ends meet through farming, tapping rubber, and raising pigs and chickens. Despite the challenges, these experiences instilled in us a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility towards our community.\n\nThe community in Sungei Pelek was like an extended family. Everyone knew everyone, and any event, whether a wedding or a funeral, involved the whole village. This sense of unity and togetherness was a defining feature of my childhood, shaping my values and relationships as I grew older. I remember walking 500 meters to school every day, a journey that was always filled with laughter and chatter with friends from different races and backgrounds. These interactions taught me the importance of diversity and acceptance, lessons that have stayed with me throughout my life.\n\nOur neighborhood was a tapestry of beliefs, with my family being one of the few Christian families in town. We respected each other's traditions, and during Christmas, we would go caroling from house to house, sharing the joy of the season with our Buddhist neighbors. This mutual respect and celebration of different cultures enriched our lives and deepened my appreciation for the diverse world we live in. Chinese New Year was another highlight of our year, as the entire village came alive with decorations, new clothes, and the exchange of angpows, those cherished red packets filled with money. These celebrations were more than just festive occasions; they were opportunities to strengthen bonds and create lasting memories with family and neighbors.\n\nMy Christian upbringing played a significant role in shaping my worldview. Attending the Methodist English school and participating in the children's Sunday service at the Methodist church in Sungei Pelek taught me the values of love and service.

                "text": "Sungei Pelek, my birthplace, holds a special place in my heart. Nestled in the state of Selangor, Malaysia, this small town, just a short drive from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, is where my journey began. The name itself, derived from the Malay word “sungei” meaning “river,” speaks to the natural beauty and serenity that surrounded my childhood home. Growing up in Sungei Pelek, I was part of a large family, with two brothers and seven sisters, living together in a modest wooden house with just five rooms. Life was not easy; our family made ends meet through farming, tapping rubber, and raising pigs and chickens. Despite the challenges, these experiences instilled in us a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility towards our community.\n\nThe community in Sungei Pelek was like an extended family. Everyone knew everyone, and any event, whether a wedding or a funeral, involved the whole village. This sense of unity and togetherness was a defining feature of my childhood, shaping my values and relationships as I grew older. I remember walking 500 meters to school every day, a journey that was always filled with laughter and chatter with friends from different races and backgrounds. These interactions taught me the importance of diversity and acceptance, lessons that have stayed with me throughout my life.\n\nOur neighborhood was a tapestry of beliefs, with my family being one of the few Christian families in town. We respected each other's traditions, and during Christmas, we would go caroling from house to house, sharing the joy of the season with our Buddhist neighbors. This mutual respect and celebration of different cultures enriched our lives and deepened my appreciation for the diverse world we live in. Chinese New Year was another highlight of our year, as the entire village came alive with decorations, new clothes, and the exchange of angpows, those cherished red packets filled with money. These celebrations were more than just festive occasions; they were opportunities to strengthen bonds and create lasting memories with family and neighbors.\n\nMy Christian upbringing played a significant role in shaping my worldview. Attending the Methodist English school and participating in the children's Sunday service at the Methodist church in Sungei Pelek taught me the values of love and service. The teachings of Jesus, especially the Bible verse John 3:16, have been a source of inspiration and guidance throughout my life. I learned that life is fleeting, and one day we will meet God in heaven.

This passion steered me towards a career in accounting, a profession held in high regard alongside engineering and medicine during my formative years.\n\nMy educational journey in Kuala Lumpur at Tunku Abdul Rahman College, followed by a Master's in Finance at the University of Lancaster in Britain, was more than just academic progression; it was a period of personal growth that shaped my worldview and professional ethos. In 1977, I embarked on my career as an accounts trainee at Coopers & Lybrand in Kuala Lumpur, where I earned a modest $120 monthly. Despite the low pay, the wealth of knowledge I gained in finalizing corporate accounts was invaluable.\n\nI soon found joy in teaching accounting and computer studies at Kinabalu Commercial College, where I could impart my knowledge to aspiring students . By 1979, I had ventured into the role of an internal auditor with Hap Seng Group in Tawau, auditing timber camps across Sabah, often by helicopter—a unique and thrilling experience. The following year, I was headhunted by Goh Brothers, a housing developer, where I oversaw the accounts departmentand enjoyed a comfortable life.\n\nIn 1981, I returned to Singapore and joined Precision Watchcase Ltd as an accountant, handling the assembly of prestigious watch brands. This role, along with my subsequent position as a regional accountant with APV Singapore until 1988, allowed me to travel across various Asian countries, auditing their accounts and further honing my expertise. However, after years in accounting, I was drawn to the real estate industry, prompted by friends' invitations. This new chapter, which I embarked on before retiring in 2020, was carefree and exciting. \nThroughout my career, the principles of accounting have been a guiding force, enabling me to manage not only business finances but also my personal ones.\n\n\n\n",

However, in the late 1980s, I decided to switch professions and join the real estate industry, thanks to an invitation from some friends.\n\nLife in the real estate industry was carefree and exciting. I found that my background in accounting and finance proved to be incredibly valuable in this new field. This skillset, combined with my passion for the industry, made my transition into real estate a smooth one.\n\nTo further enhance my knowledge and skills in the real estate market, I attended courses that taught me the right tactics and timing. In Singapore, investing in good locations is crucial, and as a real estate agent, I was able to advise clients and make money for them too. This led to many clients becoming friends, and their continued trust in me helped me grow more confident in my abilities.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments during my time in the real estate industry was my ability to invest in properties during bad times and sell during good times. This strategy allowed me to make some money and reinvest it, giving me a great sense of achievement in life. My diverse career journey, from accounting to teaching and then to real estate, has shaped my skills and perspectives over the years, making me an all-rounder in the professional world.\n\nA personal experience that stands out is when I bought a City Square Residences condominium because of its prime location and freehold status. It was easy to rent and has since appreciated  in value. The condominium is located near an MRT station and a shopping mall, making it an attractive investment. \n\nThese client-turned-friend relationships had a significant impact on my life and career decisions. Some clients continued to recommend more clients to me, which helped my career as a realtor keep progressing. Building trust and confidence with my clients was essential for my personal growth and success in the real estate industry.\n\nThere were times when I had to handle challenging situations and calm clients down. I learned to use a soft approach and talk to them diplomatically. This wise approach made a huge difference in resolving conflicts and keeping deals on track. However, I also learned not to take things for granted. I once bought a property, and the lawyer forgot to exercise the contract on the due date, resulting in the deal being canceled. I should have been more alert by reminding her of the deadline. This experience taught me the importance of being proactive and vigilant in my dealings.\n\nAfter this incident, I made sure to always check the deadlines of my deals and not rely on others, like lawyers, to inform me. This change in my approach helped me prevent similar issues in the future and ensured smoother transactions for my clients.\n\nAfter many years in the real estate industry, I finally retired in 2020. Looking back, I am grateful for the experiences and opportunities that my career has provided me. The real estate industry has been an integral part of my life.  My final piece of advice in real estate is always to buy based on location, location, and location. You never go wrong. Don't listen to others blindly.",

I'm grateful that our government encourages fitness by offering free gym entry for seniors like myself. This support has allowed me to maintain my interest in working out and staying active.\n\nSwimming has also been a significant part of my life, starting from college and continuing until today. I find it to be an excellent way to stay fit and take care of my body. I believe that we must love our bodies, and going to the gym and swimming regularly are my ways of showing that love.\n\nLiving near a reservoir has been a blessing, as it provides a beautiful and breezy environment for jogging and brisk walks. I occasionally jog there, taking in the stunning sights and enjoying the calming atmosphere. The setting sun against the reservoir is a sight to behold, with the big red sun casting a warm glow over the water. The gentle blue waves and the cool breeze make me feel calm and relaxed, washing away any stress I might have.\nAfter a jog, I often sit on a rock beside the water, close my eyes, and let the tranquility of the surroundings envelop me. It's moments like these that make me appreciate the beauty of nature and the importance of staying active and healthy.In conclusion, hobbies are important as they give us something to look forward to daily, whether we are still working or retired. They keep us fit and healthy, thus lessening the government's burden of caring for us. My relationship with the gym has been a significant part of my life, helping me stay fit, healthy, and focused on my goals. It's a place where I can unwind, relieve stress, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had to stay active and the support I've received from my government and community. I hope to continue prioritizing my health and fitness, as well as serving others through my community work and faith. For those looking to discover new hobbies or interests, I would advise you to look for hobbies you are passionate about and spend more time to develop them. At the end of the day, you will find life is worth living.\n\n",

            "details": "Cooking and baking are the essence of my being, the threads that weave through the fabric of my life, binding together the rich tapestry of my family's history and traditions. In the sanctuary of my kitchen, I find solace and joy in the act of creating dishes that are a testament to our past and a beacon for our future. Each recipe, each ingredient tells a story—a narrative of where we've come from and the path we're paving forward.\n\nMy mother's red wine chicken, a dish vibrant in hue and rich in flavor, is a tradition I've proudly carried on since she passed away. The whole dish is red in color due to the rice wine, and the taste is simply awesome. It's cooked with chicken, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, sugar, and salt, and can be savored with rice or rice vermicelli. I remember the joy it brought during Chinese New Year when I was young, and now, I continue to cook it to keep the memory of my mother alive and to carry on the tradition she cherished.\n\nMy sisters, excellent cooks in their own right, shared their culinary wisdom with me, teaching me the ingredients and steps to create these beloved dishes. Though my siblings and I now have our individual homes, I cook for my family during festivals, and when friends come over, I prepare special dishes that are not easily available in restaurants. The sweet sour fish maw with sea cucumber is a second favorite, a dish that is very appetizing and often requested by my children and friends alike.\n\nThe black belly pork, with its tempting flavors of cinnamon, pepper, and garlic, is another family favorite that I've refined over the years. I've added my own twist by marinating it for a day to enhance the aroma, and sometimes, I'll add sliced yam to give the dish more volume, creating a hearty meal that's both satisfying and reminiscent of my parents' cooking.\n\nMy love for cheese naturally led me to baking cheesecakes, a delightful shift from the savory dishes I usually prepare. Whether unbaked or baked, these cheesecakes are a testament to my culinary artistry. The carrot cheesecake, with its white frosting and nuts, is a perfect example of my commitment to combining health with indulgence. The praise from an elderly lady at church, who called my carrot cheesecake the best she'd ever had, fills me with happiness and motivates me to continue experimenting with different toppings and seasonal fruits.\n\nCooking and baking are more than j ust preparing food; they are the heart of our family. The dishes I create are not just meals; they are the canvas upon which my family's history is painted, a culinary tapestry rich with tradition and flavor. My journey with food is deeply rooted in the heritage of the Chinese dialect group Fuzhou, from which many of my recipes originate. These dishes, with their succulent meats and rich spices, are narratives that have been passed down through generations.\n\nThe handwritten recipe on paper is more than mere instructions; it's a blueprint of our past and a promise for our future. Even as my children grow and their lives become too busy for cooking, their love for the dishes ensures that our culinary traditions will endure. The symbols on the recipe paper are not just ingredients and measurements; they represent the innovation intertwined with the tradition, a new chapter in our family's gastronomic saga.\n\nIn my kitchen, dish after dish, I paint the story of my family, a story of resilience, love, and the joy of home cooking. It's a joy as lasting and satisfying as the cheesecake itself, a symbol of my passion for blending tradition with my own unique flair. Cooking has always been a thread woven through the fabric of my life, a tradition that binds my family together and keeps our heritage alive. It's more than just a hobby for me; it's a way of honoring my parents and the memories we shared.\n\nI remember the boat trips to visit my brother-in-law in Kapit, a time when river transport was the lifeline of our journeys. Those trips, now replaced by the convenience of highway transport, are cherished memories that remind me of the constant evolution of life. Just as the modes of travel have shifted, so too has my approach to cooking, always adapting and evolving, yet rooted in the traditions of my family.\n\nCooking is my connection to the past and a gift I share in the present. It's a legacy of love, flavor, and family that I will continue to cherish and pass down through the generations. Whether it's the red wine chicken that harkens back to festive Chinese New Year celebrations or the sweet sour fish maw with sea cucumber that tantalizes the taste buds of my guests, each dish is a chapter in my family's story, a story that I am honored to tell through the universal language of food.",

One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the National Palace Museum in Taipei. This museum houses a vast collection of rare artifacts, but the one that captivated me the most was the exquisite jadeite cabbage. This beautifully crafted piece, with its green leaves and white stem, dates back to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and is the only one of its kind on display. The jadeite cabbage has a rich history, having been brought to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek when he fled from communist China in 1949. It remains a significant artifact, attracting tourists from all over the globe.\n\nAnother memorable experience was my visit to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. The hall, with its beautiful garden, is an excellent spot for cultural sightseeing. The large statue of Chiang Kai-shek adds to the historical significance of the place, making it a must-visit for anyone interested in Taiwan's history.\n\nOne of the most exhilarating moments of my trip was the ATV ride in Hualien. Riding along the beach, facing the vast Pacific Ocean, was a mix of adventure, fear, and excitement. It was my first time standing in front of the Pacific Ocean, and the sight of the pounding waves against the rocks was breathtaking. The ride was a thrilling experience, shared with a group of friends, making it even more enjoyable and memorable.\n\nHualien also offered a culinary delight with its fresh seafood. Dining at a restaurant facing the sea, I indulged in delicious dishes like abalone, octopus, and raw fish. The red Garoupa was particularly memorable, as I had never tasted fish from the Pacific Ocean before. The freshness and flavor of the seafood made it an unforgettable culinary experience.\n\nExploring the night markets was another highlight of my trip. The Taipei Ximending market, with its wide variety of food, was a feast for the senses. I particularly enjoyed the oyster mee sua, a fine vermicelli dish that was absolutely delicious. The pungent tofu, with its strong smell but great taste, was another interesting find. I also had the chance to try some juicy and sweet custard apples, which melted in my mouth. Taiwan is also famous for its pineapple tarts, which are sold all year round with beautiful packaging.\n\nIn conclusion, my trip to Taiwan was a tapestry of thrilling adventures, fascinating discoveries, and unforgettable experiences. From the jadeite cabbage at the National Palace Museum to the beautiful shores of Hualien, the delicious seafood, and the amazing street food at the night markets, Taiwan has left an indelible mark on my heart. I will always cherish the memories of my time spent in this beautiful country, and the experiences I had will forever remain vivid in my mind.",

This  city of picturesque landscapes, has deepened my bond with the place. The most memorable place I visited was the Neuschwanstein Castle with its   towers  and sit on the rugged hills . It is an iconic example of the Romantic style and remains a recognisable symbol of Bavaria and Germany.\n\nMalaysia -Kota Kinabalu is a beautiful town where I spent a year as a teacher in Kinabalu Commercial College . It is a vibrant town with diverse cultures .\n\nIn Sarawak  I often visited Kapit, my wife’s hometown. The express boat trips along the river to Kapit were a tradition that remained unchanged until the recent development of a highway. While I may feel nostalgic for those boat trips, the convenience of the highway is undeniable, marking a significant shift in the local way of life.\n\nAmerica- The United States holds a special place in my heart as well. My third son, Derek Tan, and his wife, Isabelle Kong, both graduated from the University of Michigan. Visiting them allowed me to combine a family visit with witnessing the natural wonder of Niagara Falls. The white foam and green edges of the falls were quite vivid, and the emotions I felt witnessing Niagara Falls up close were indescribable. Two of the most memorable  places I visited were Harvard university and MIT. The buildings were majestic  and iconic . Though I do not have a chance to study there , at least I felt a sense of happiness of  being able to be there visiting and seeing all the bright students from all over the globe . Really proud and happy for them . \n\nFinland-In Finland, I had the extraordinary experience of visiting igloos. Although I never stayed overnight due to time constraints, sitting inside one for a while was beautiful, albeit cold. The igloos with glass roofs offered a glimpse into the serene yet harsh Arctic environment.\n\n\n\nUK-\nMy relationship with Cambridge University is one that fills me with immense pride, not because I studied there, but because it's where my second son, Jason Tan and  his wife, Sarine Zhou . They graduated from this prestigious institution, and their time at Cambridge was a period of intense learning and growth.  I recalled my visit with a sense of nostalgia and admiration. It was not just the university's architecture that left an impression on me, but also the intellectual atmosphere that seemed to permeate every corner of the campus.\n\nNew Zealand-\nDuring my visit to New Zealand, a place where sheep outnumber people, I was captivated by the pastoral beauty and the art of sheep shearing. The demonstration was a standout experience, showcasing the country's deep connection to sheep farming. I still remember the picturesque scene: a herd of sheep grazing with the majestic mountains in the backdrop, a memory so vivid I captured it in a photograph. The contrast of the white sheep against the mountain grandeur was striking, and I felt compelled to photograph them up close to capture the essence of New Zealand's countryside. New Zealand, with its lush landscapes and unique agricultural practices, left an indelible mark on me. The experience was unlike any other, and it stood in stark contrast to the urban vibrancy .\nHong Kong- \nIt’s another beautiful bustling city which I never get tired to visit . Famous for their mouth-watering tim sum ,where I often miss the salted yolk custard buns.",

They graduated from this prestigious institution, and their time at Cambridge was a period of intense learning and growth.  I recalled my visit with a sense of nostalgia and admiration. It was not just the university's architecture that left an impression on me, but also the intellectual atmosphere that seemed to permeate every corner of the campus.\n\nNew Zealand-\nDuring my visit to New Zealand, a place where sheep outnumber people, I was captivated by the pastoral beauty and the art of sheep shearing. The demonstration was a standout experience, showcasing the country's deep connection to sheep farming. I still remember the picturesque scene: a herd of sheep grazing with the majestic mountains in the backdrop, a memory so vivid I captured it in a photograph. The contrast of the white sheep against the mountain grandeur was striking, and I felt compelled to photograph them up close to capture the essence of New Zealand's countryside. New Zealand, with its lush landscapes and unique agricultural practices, left an indelible mark on me. The experience was unlike any other, and it stood in stark contrast to the urban vibrancy .\nHong Kong- \nIt’s another beautiful bustling city which I never get tired to visit . Famous for their mouth-watering tim sum ,where I often miss the salted yolk custard buns.",

I grew up in a Christian family, and my faith was nurtured within the walls of a Methodist English primary school and the vibrant community of our local Methodist church. It was there, amidst the tales of Jesus' love and sacrifice, that my heart became intertwined with the teachings of Christ. I learned of a love so profound that it could forgive sins and offer the hope of an eternal life, a concept beautifully encapsulated in John 3:16, a verse that has become a cornerstone of my faith.\n\nAs I matured, the values Jesus taught—love for our neighbors and God, kindness, and humility—became the guiding principles of my life. I've been blessed with opportunities to participate in mission trips and outreach programs, such as the day trip to Batam, Indonesia. There, we visited a children's home, sharing the message of Jesus and distributing goodies to the children. Their smiles, so pure despite their hardships, were a testament to the transformative power of Jesus' love, a power I am committed to sharing with others.\n\nMy faith has been a beacon during life's storms, offering solace and strength. I recall a time when I was hospitalized for surgery, feeling anxious and uncertain. It was through prayer and the comfort of Philippians 4:6-7 that I found peace, and it was in the fellowship of Sunday service that I found the courage to face my challenges. \n\n \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, my relationship with Jesus is the compass by which I navigate the world. It shapes my values, influences my perspective, and inspires my actions. Through mission trips, outreach programs, and personal encounters, I am dedicated to sharing the transformative power of Jesus' love. As I look to the future, I am filled with excitement for the adventures that await and the opportunities to serve. I am reminded that life is fleeting, and it is my heartfelt desire to live each day in a way that honors Jesus and brings me one step closer to the joy and tearless existence promised in heaven.",

My relationship with the Old Folks Home, a cornerstone of my service, began with my volunteering at AWWA. Monthly, I would visit, distributing fruits and sharing precious moments with the elderly residents. There are about 120 of them, each with their own stories and wisdom, and through them, I've learned the importance of staying strong and fit as I age.\n\nI've witnessed the spectrum of human emotions in these halls. Once, two ladies, initially friends, quarreled over money, turning into enemies. It was a stark reminder of how conflicts can escalate and the importance of promoting harmony. I've always tried to be a peacemaker, encouraging forgiveness and reminding the residents that life is too short for petty disagreements. \n\nMy efforts to foster unity extend to organizing fellowship gatherings, where we sing, share, and discuss the essence of happiness, love, and forgiveness. These moments are precious; they bring us together and remind us of the shared human experience. Christmas is especially memorable. We decorate the hall, sing carols, and share stories of transformation and redemption. Once, we even had ex-convict singers perform, their testimonies of change touching everyone's hearts.\n\nOne of my most cherished experiences was visiting an elderly gentleman in his home. Our conversations about community work and life updates have deepened our bond, and it's a humbling reminder of the impact we can have on one another's lives. Despite my wanderlust, my commitment to serving others remains unwavering. The Old Folks Home has been a haven of learning and giving, and I intend to continue my service there. My faith guides me, and I strive to do things pleasing to God, for I believe my ultimate destination is with Him in heaven.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion I hope to inspire others to find their passion in service, to seek harmony and understanding, and to live a life filled with purpose. Whether it's through the simple act of distributing fruits or the deeper engagement of heartfelt conversations, every moment counts. And as I look to the horizon, ready to embark on new journeys, I know that the essence of my work in the community will always be a part of who I am. It's a legacy of love, faith, and service that I hope to leave behind, a testament to a life well-lived and a future filled with hope.",
